## 1. Scalars and Vectors

### Scalars
* Scalars are regular numbers like 1,2,3...
* They have only magnitude
* Scalars are denoted as $$a,b,c ...$$

### Vectors
* Vectors are described by various ways.
* In physics, vectors are pointing arrows
* In computer science, vectors are ordered list of numbers
* In general, vectors are n-dimensional value that contains direction and magnitude.
* Vectors are denoted as $$\vec{a},\vec{b},...$$
* In vector, there are two main operations :
    * Vector addition
    * Vector multiplication
 
#### Vector Addition
* Vector addition is the sum of two vectors.
* For example,

$$\vec{a} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]$$

$$\vec{b} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ -1 \end{array} \right]$$

$$\vec{c} = \vec{a}$$ + $$\vec{b}$$

Where $$\vec{c}$$ is calculated as,

$$\vec{c} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1+3 \\ 2-1 \end{array} \right]$$

$$\vec{c} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]$$

#### Vector Multiplication
* Vector multiplication is also called as scalar multiplication where a scaler $$a$$ is multiplied with a vector $$\vec{a}$$ to form a scaled vector
